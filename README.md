# AdvocacyProject

The website serves two purposes. Firstly, it aims to raise awareness about the consequences of societal ignorance regarding wildlife, encouraging individuals to take action rather than relying solely on higher authorities. 
Secondly, the website is designed to be accessible to people of all ages, meaning, I want to create a website thatâ€™s not complicated in any case! The goal is to create a user friendly platform without any unnecessary complications. 
Additionally, I want to ensure a creative environment, so when users view the website they can be entertained and engaged in the content they see. 

The intended users for this website are catered to individuals who primarily consume news online through social media platforms rather than traditional television sources or other sources. 
Many people have the ability to make a positive impact on the environment. However, I believe there is often ill intention in the media. Therefore, the goal is to create an unbiased social awareness web page where users can access news and information on ways to contribute without the influence of media bias.
